# Telegram_Group

Pull a user list from Telegram using *telethon API* and exporting them to a CSV file containing Username, First Name, Last name

I still have problems with the unicode characters, so I have to manually insert the name of users with russian symbols or *á,é,ü, etc...*.

Ideas are welcome.

To be able to use this script you must generate an user_id and a user_hash by going to my.telegram.org.
